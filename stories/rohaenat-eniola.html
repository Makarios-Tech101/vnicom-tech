            <p>
                My name is Rohaenat Eniola Mustapha, I am from Kwara. I am a 17 years old girl studying Software Engineering in African Leadership University, Rwanda and aspiring to be a Software Engineer. I see myself in the future as someone who can solve the major problems in Nigeria which hinders our progress by using the skills I am learning with the help of Vnicom Tech hub and My University.

            </h3>
            <p>
                I am a software engineering student of African Leadership University and I have an IT background. During my holidays, I squeeze my time to go to Vnicom hub to improve my knowledge base. I learnt python programming language which is currently helping in my studies and as for this year, I studied UI/UX design, Graphic design and Product design.

            <p>
                Ever since I was little, I have wanted to change and improve Nigeria's Tourism to help build the economy and make Nigeria a place where foreigners don't feel threatened by us.

            </h3>
            <p>
                It has been so great! My parents played a vital role in making me attend physical classes at Vnicom Tech hub. I wanted an online course at Coursera instead. Begrudgingly, I started my classes, it didn’t take up to a week for me to see how nice everyone was. The tutors were patient with our learning process and accommodating. Young as I was, I was never mocked or judged which made learning an interesting one which made me come back for another course during my school holiday. Thank you so much Vnicom for your support and help through my learning journey and I am sure that with your help, I will get a good degree and achieve my goal.

                Q: What advice do you have for others who are looking to start out in tech and join your track?


            </h3>
            <p>
                If someone is looking to start a career in tech, the advice I have for them is Stay Passionate. Tech can be challenging, but a genuine passion for what you're doing will keep you motivated and help you persevere through difficulties. Remember that everyone's journey in tech is unique. Be patient, stay curious, and keep learning, and you'll be on the right track to a successful tech career.

            <p>
                Yes, I actually have started building up on my goal - improving Nigeria's economy by improving Infrastructure in the Tourism aspect. We are a group of five that consists of different people from different countries in Africa. We share the same goal and we hope we could change Africa as a continent once we are done with Nigeria. I am one of the backend developers in the project we are building. Although that wouldn't be the only thing I will be doing, I will seek better opportunities with my skills hopefully which can also enhance my skills and experience along the way. And I am also looking to do my internship training in Vnicom Tech Hub.
