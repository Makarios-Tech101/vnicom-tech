            <p>
                I’m Fatai Balikis Opeyemi. I’m from Osun State currently based in Osogbo. I’m planning on relocating to
                Lagos, very soon. I studied Agriculture at the University of Ilorin.

            </h3>
            <p>
                I didn’t come from a technical background. The course I studied in school was not in any way tech
                related. I studied Agriculture. I learned about tech through one of my friends in NYSC. He put a call
                through just to check up on me but that led to a very serious conversation. 80% of the conversation we
                had was about tech. That piqued my curiosity. I began to read about web development but see who
                chickened out in a week. Coding looked so hard so I forfeited it for graphic design.

                Money was my motivation initially when I learned about how much people earn in tech. Who no like better
                thing? When I kick-started my UI/UX career, it became a thing of passion for me. I love to design, I
                love to solve problems and this became my motivation. Having a problem to solve motivates me; it gives
                me the room to showcase my ability.

            </h3>
            <p>
                It wasn't easy. You should know what you're ready for before you start anything. I knew I was going to
                burn data so I was ready for it. There were days my data finished in the middle of working. I had
                sleepless nights several times that I became so lean. I'm still lean anyway. I told myself that I'm not
                going to stop this no matter what. I've started this and I've to see it to the end. There were days I
                doubted myself. I struggled with inconsistency in the first month of my training but this got better
                with time.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Vnicom Tech Hub eased and sped up my learning process. I must say it is a platform specifically ordained
                by God for me to be trained in. The 3 months learning experience I had in their bootcamp changed my
                story for the better. Everything I can design today was as a result of the training I had in the
                bootcamp. I was not just trained to design, I had access to a lot of helpful information online. I'm a
                proud product of this learning platform. The experience was tremendous. Shout out to My tutor Mr.
                Akinjide Stanley.

            <p>
                My story is enough to motivate you. You don't need to have a background in Computer Science to learn any
                tech skill. Be trained in a learning platform, take an online course, watch YouTube videos. In whatever
                you do, consistency is key. If you're consistent, it takes you a shorter time to achieve your goals.

                I recently got a job in Pacer labs, a tech company in Lagos. I’m employed as a junior UI/UX designer. I
                didn’t even apply for the job. The CEO saw my design and asked that I send my resume and portfolio. I
                was interviewed the following week. I got the job the week that followed. Sept. 18th, 2023 was my first day at
                work.
