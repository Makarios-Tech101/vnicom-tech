                    My name is Mayowa Oyeniran. I am a graduate of Computer Engineering and currently reside in Magboro, Ogun State.

                <p>
                    "Yes, I am from a technical background. I hold 
                    a degree in Computer Engineering, which provided 
                    a strong foundation in both hardware and software 
                    systems. My academic training covered areas such as 
                    digital systems, computer architecture, programming, 
                    networking, and embedded systems.
                    My interest in technology deepened during university, 
                    where I engaged in practical projects and self-learning 
                    beyond the curriculum. I explored areas like web development, 
                    software engineering, and IT infrastructure, which eventually 
                    shaped my current path in tech. Since graduation, 
                    I’ve continued to build on this foundation through 
                    hands-on experience, internships, and personal projects

                <p>
                    My motivation to pursue a career in tech came 
                    from a combination of curiosity, creativity, and 
                    a desire to solve real-world problems.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The journey has been both challenging and rewarding. 
                    Starting out, there was a steep learning curve most 
                    especially transitioning from academic theory to 
                    real-world application. But every challenge has helped 
                    me grow stronger. I’ve gained hands-on experience through 
                    projects, internships, and team collaborations that pushed 
                    me to think critically, adapt quickly, and stay curious.

                <p>
                    "My training experience at Vnicom Tech Hub was 
                    both intensive and transformative. It provided a 
                    solid practical foundation in key areas of software 
                    development and exposed me to real-world projects that 
                    sharpened my problem-solving and technical skills. 
                    It helped emphasized hands-on learning, collaboration, 
                    and accountability which made the learning process very 
                    engaging and impactful.

                    I particularly appreciated the mentorship and guidance 
                    from experienced instructors, as well as the focus on 
                    industry-relevant tools and best practices. We worked on 
                    real-life client projects, which helped me build confidence 
                    in writing clean code, managing timelines, and communicating 
                    effectively within a team.

                    Overall, the experience at Vnicom Tech Hub played a major
                     role in preparing me for the demands of the tech industry, 
                     and it continues to shape how I approach learning and growth
